This sample demonstrates how to wrap msi in the executable without building a bootstrapper.It is required for the cases when the msi is to be started programmatically, like in <wixsharp>\Source\src\WixSharp.Samples\Wix# Samples\Bootstrapper\WixBootstrapper_EmbeddedUI sample.To build teh example execute Build_msi.cmd and then build the Self-executable_Msi.csproj project with Visual Studio.The produced ManagedSetup.exe can be:- Installed with `ManagedSetup.exe /i` - Uninstalled with `ManagedSetup.exe /x`
